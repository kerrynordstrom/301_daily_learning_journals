Today (one day late, I guess?????  Staggered weekend due dates
  ``¯\_(ツ)_/¯`` ), I was working my side job delivering food and was just about to wrap up when a fella on another nice bike pulled over to talk to me.  We chatted about our rides for a few minutes, then the topic of conversation turned to the ability to reinvent oneself once, twice, or more in a lifetime.  He basically told me that I should never fall into the trap of thinking this is impossible or that the competition is too stiff to try.  He's currently on his second reinvention, doing technical copywriting as he realized that's where his strengths lie.  As I get ready to start attending a bunch of meet ups and in a couple months time, prepare myself for interviews, I frequently need to be reminded that I am more than the languages I am learning and will eventually know.  

  Related to today's work....still chipping away at reading the MDN docs in order to fully understand .map(), .filter(), and .reduce().  This, combined, with modules has led me to doing lots of console work to see where things are or are not defined.
