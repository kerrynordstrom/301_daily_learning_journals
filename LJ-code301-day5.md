Today I learned to ask more questions prior to digging into the assignment so that I can see the high level expectations to the assignment rather than attempting to figure these things out on my own.  The READMEs are complicated to parse and lead to lots of imaginative wandering as to the purpose of the assignment.  Perhaps in the future, I will ask my classmates more specific questions to figure out their understanding of the assignment prior to tackling it on my own.
