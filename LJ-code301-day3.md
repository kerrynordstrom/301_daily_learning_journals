Today I learned that it is important to spend time with the starter code, whereby I do my best to determine its various purposes and look for any functionality that might be missing or that will need to be commented out as we test features.  Today, my lab partner and I likely made in error in copying the starter code or simply did not realize why our code was behaving the way it was on page load.  It is possible, however; that properly placed console logs as well as having the console open prior to page load would've revealed the reason for the odd behavior beforehand.
